I built this Calculator Microservice using Node.js and Express, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with more advanced operations such as exponentiation, square root, and modulo. The microservice is designed to handle HTTP GET requests where users provide numbers as query parameters (e.g., num1 and num2), and I return the results of the requested operation.
To ensure a smooth experience, I incorporated robust error handling that checks for invalid inputs like missing or non-numeric values. If there's an issue with the request, I return meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 404 for unsupported operations, and 500 for server errors).
Each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, and modulo) has its own dedicated route with validation checks. The service is accessible via http://localhost:3000, and you can test it using directly in a browser.
Additionally, I added a global error handler to catch unexpected issues, log them, and provide a generic error message. This microservice showcases simple REST API design while ensuring that users have a seamless and reliable experience, even when errors occur.
