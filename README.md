In this task, I pushed the Calculator API to Google Cloud as part of Dockerizing the application to ensure it is stored and managed in a scalable and secure cloud environment. First, I authenticated with Google Cloud using the gcloud auth command, which securely linked my local machine to Google Cloud services. This step was crucial to enable the interaction between Docker and Google Cloud. Next, I configured Google Container Registry (GCR), a managed service provided by Google Cloud that allows me to store Docker images, ensuring that my application could be deployed and accessed from the cloud. After that, I tagged the Docker image to match the format required by Google Cloud, specifying the project and repository name, and then I pushed the image to GCR using the docker push command. This action successfully uploaded the Calculator API image to the cloud, making it available for future deployment. By pushing the image to GCR, I was able to store the Calculator API image securely in the cloud, which not only ensured easy deployment but also allowed me to scale the application efficiently and manage it with Google Cloud's services. This process of pushing to Google Cloud enabled better flexibility, ensuring that the application can be easily accessed and maintained from the cloud, facilitating continuous updates and deployment automation as the project progresses.



I successfully Dockerized the Calculator API by following a structured approach. Initially, I created a Dockerfile in the root directory of the project, which set up the Node.js environment, copied the necessary project files, installed the required dependencies using npm, and exposed port 3000 for the API. Additionally, I created a docker-compose.yml file to simplify container management, ensuring that the container ran in detached mode and the correct port mappings were set. After building the Docker image using docker-compose up --build -d, I verified the applicationâ€™s functionality by testing the API endpoints (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) in the browser . Once confirmed, I pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub, making it publicly accessible. Finally, I committed all the changes, including the Docker configuration files (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml), to a GitHub repository, ensuring that the project was version-controlled and shareable. This Dockerization process ensures the Calculator API is portable and can run consistently across any environment with Docker, facilitating easy deployment and collaboration.


I built this Calculator Microservice using Node.js and Express, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with more advanced operations such as exponentiation, square root, and modulo. The microservice is designed to handle HTTP GET requests where users provide numbers as query parameters (e.g., num1 and num2), and I return the results of the requested operation.
To ensure a smooth experience, I incorporated robust error handling that checks for invalid inputs like missing or non-numeric values. If there's an issue with the request, I return meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 404 for unsupported operations, and 500 for server errors).
Each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, and modulo) has its own dedicated route with validation checks. The service is accessible via http://localhost:3000, and you can test it using directly in a browser.
Additionally, I added a global error handler to catch unexpected issues, log them, and provide a generic error message. This microservice showcases simple REST API design while ensuring that users have a seamless and reliable experience, even when errors occur.
